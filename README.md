# **Applied Artificial Inteligence**

## **Overview**
This repository contains a collection of hands-on machine learning projects demonstrating fundamental AI concepts through practical implementations. From disease prediction to reinforcement learning, each project explores different aspect of artificial intelligence using real-world datasets and industry-standard tools.

## **Projects Included**

### **1. Disease Prediction System**
A comprehensive machine learning solution that predicts diseases based on 132 symptoms across 42 conditions. Implements both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze medical data and uncover hidden patterns.

**Techniques Used:**
- Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
- Regression (Linear Regression)
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

### **2. Q-Learning Grid World**
An interactive reinforcement learning demonstration where an agent learns to navigate mazes through trial and error. Features a visual grid environment with customizable obstacles and real-time Q-table visualization.

**Key Features:**
- Editable grid maps
- Real-time learning visualization
- Hyperparameter tuning interface
- Graphical Q-table representation

## **Learning Objectives**
- Understand core ML concepts through hands-on implementation
- Explore the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
- Gain experience with data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Recognize ethical considerations in AI applications

## **Tools & Technologies**
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- Matplotlib, seaborn for visualizations
- Tkinter for interactive GUI
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis
